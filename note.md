- stateless servers & structured access to resources
- strict specification
- hard to adapt to the front end change

GraphQL

- easily adapt to front end change
- makes one POST request to an endpoint to get everything

- faster feedback cycles
- uses its own type system strong type system to define capabilities of API
- schema serves as contract between client and server
